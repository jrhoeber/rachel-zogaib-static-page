                    <h3>Teaching Experience</h3>
                    <p>
                    Currently, I am a K-6 Art Teacher at West Buffalo Charter School in Buffalo, NY. As WBCS’s Art Teacher, I design and implement curriculum for all 19 of my classes in a variety of mediums and at varying skill levels. Before starting at WBCS, I completed my student teaching placements through SUNY Buffalo State at Cloverbank Elementary School in the Frontier Central School District and at Hamburg High School. Through my various teaching experiences, I have worked with students ranging from ages 4-18 (pK-12). </p>
                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>This Fall, I began pursuing a Master’s of Science Degree in Creative Studies through the International Center for Studies in Creativity at Buffalo State, as I am very interested in the innate relationships between the fields of Creative Studies and Art Education. In May of 2017 I earned my Bachelor’s of Science, Summa Cum Laude, in Art Education at Buffalo State.

                    <h3>About me</h3>
                    <p>
                        My name is Rachel Zogaib, and I currently teach K-6 Art at West Buffalo Charter School, in buffalo New York. I grew up in Hamburg, NY, just 30 minutes south of Buffalo, and graduated from Hamburg High School where I decided to go into Art Education. I recently graduated from SUNY Buffalo State College with my B.S. in Art Education, and am currently pursuing a M.S. in Creative Studies at Buffalo State as well. Through my educational experiences, I have had the opportunity to work with students on all levels (PreK-12), and at various stages of ability. I am fluent in a variety of studio areas through which I will plan my instruction, and I am so excited to share as many art making processes with your children as possible!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As an art teacher, I strive to share that art can be accessed, appreciated, utilized and taken part in by each and every child regardless of traditional “artistic ability.” I hope to share my passion, love, and appreciation for art with my students in order to help them to not only grow as individuals and to expand their breadth of knowledge, but also to learn how to use and understand art in ways that are meaningful to them.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Many important skills can be learned in the art room, and I want my students to be able to take away a sense of responsibility, ownership of their art, appreciation for their art, as well as time management skills, critical thinking, and above all to realize the importance of thinking creatively.

                <h2>Current Trends in Creative Education</h2>
                <h3>Collaborative Learning</h3>
                <div class="resource">
                    “Collaborative learning is an educational approach to teaching and learning that involves groups of students working together to solve a problem, complete a task, or create a product.”
                    <br><br>
                    Collaboration is a very valuable skill for our students to learn and practice, beginning as early as possible in their educational experiences. The Art Room is an especially appropriate place to introduce collaborative learning activities, and a lot can be learned from working together and creating works of art in a group, rather than just as individuals. Collaboration teaches our students to be aware of diverse viewpoints and perspectives, and opens their mind to new ideas and concepts, which can truly increase both the breadth and depth of the artwork that they create.

                <h3>Mindfulness in the Classroom</h3>
                <div class="resource">
                    “Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we’re doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on around us.”
                    <br><br>
                    In recent years, there has been an increasing amount of research that supports practicing mindfulness with our students in the classroom, beginning at as young of an age as possible. There are so many ways that educators can integrate mindfulness activities into their lessons, and there are so many benefits that come along with doing so. When our students learn to practice mindfulness, they are able to form deeper connections with content, approach their studies with less stress and anxiety, and learn how to deal with problems that may arise in the classroom with calm and logical responses.
